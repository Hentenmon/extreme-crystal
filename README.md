# Pokémon Crystal - 60 fps

This is a showcase of working 60 fps and running shoes in Pokémon Crystal.
This is based off of other implementations, such in [Orange](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange)
and [Polished Crystal's optimization branch](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal).

## Quirks

While the feature is very desirable there are quirks in the implementation.
I will get around to documenting these quirks better at a later date.
